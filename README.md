### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anton Valkenberg :)
This page is my Portfolio, where I'd like to share some awesome projects that I've had the pleasure to work on, focused on Games & A.I.

#### Current version: 0.1.0 (rough draft of the projects/games I want to highlight)
</br>
</br>

#### HunterKiller (Java version)
During my Master in Artificial Intelligence, I was able to run an internship at Codepoke working under G.J. Roelofs. Together we created HunterKiller as a game in which we could research various search techniques.</br>
Below you can see HunterKiller running on a test-map, which was specifically designed to enable us to efficiently and rigorously test new techniques and adjustments:</br>

</br>
Here is an example of one of the fully sized maps that were created to test the performance of the different techniques:

##### Implemented techniques
- Various heuristic-based bots using value-maps, some examples:
	- Squad bot, which preferred to keep it's units together in small squads while moving
	- Scout bot, which preferred to scout out the enemy's position and highly valued field-of-view coverage
	- Rules bot, which acted based on preconstructed behaviour-rules
- Hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (HMCTS)
- NaÃ¯ve Monte Carlo Search (NMC)
- Linear Side Information (LSI)

For pathfinding, all of the bots used a combination of A* and value-maps.
Note that the engine included a full field-of-view/line-of-sight implementation.

##### Report on research results
Check [this link](/Documents/Internship_report.pdf) for the report on the research I did during my internship.
It also outlines my proposed enhancement to the HMCTS technique; using side-information for move ordering during the expansion phase of the search.

##### Code
The code for HunterKiller's engine can be found in [the HunterKiller repository](https://github.com/antonvalkenberg/HunterKiller).
